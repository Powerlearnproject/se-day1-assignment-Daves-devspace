(a) Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-The systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
Importance of software engineering in the technology industry
 . It plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including 
   communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.
  
(b) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 The evolution of software engineering has been marked by several significant milestones that highlight advancements in technology, development practices, and the 
 increasing 
 complexity of software systems.
 .The Development of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
   During the 1960s and 1970s, software development often lacked organization, resulting in unstructured and difficult-to-manage code. As software systems became more 
   complex, it became evident that a more systematic approach was needed.
.The Introduction of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) (1970s-1980s)
  As software systems became increasingly essential to business and government functions in the 1970s and 1980s, the need for a systematic and repeatable process to guide 
  software development became clear. This led to the establishment of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which outlines the stages of planning, design, coding, 
  testing, and maintenance.
  Importance:
  Systematic approach to development: The SDLC framework introduced structure and discipline to the development process, simplifying the management of complex software 
  projects.
  Clearer project planning and timelines: With well-defined stages, teams could better estimate project timelines, monitor progress, and allocate resources efficiently.
  Foundation for modern methodologies: The SDLC paved the way for more adaptable and iterative approaches like Agile and DevOps, which emerged in subsequent decades
.The Agile Movement (1990s-Present)
  In the late 1990s, software development teams faced difficulties with traditional, inflexible methodologies like Waterfall, especially in rapidly evolving industries. 
  This challenge sparked the Agile movement, which prioritized flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development. In 2001, a group of software practitioners released 
  the Agile Manifesto, outlining principles for a more responsive approach to software development.
  Key concepts of Agile include the frequent delivery of functional software, close collaboration with customers, and the willingness to embrace changes even late in the 
  development cycle.
  

(c)List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 .Requirement Analysis – Understanding what users need and defining the necessary requirements.
 .System Design – Developing the architecture and overall design of the system.
 .Implementation – Writing the code and creating the software.
 .Testing – Verifying that the software is free of errors and meets the defined requirements.
 .Deployment – Releasing the software for users to access.
 .Maintenance – Updating and resolving issues with the software after it has been launched.
 
 The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) offers a systematic approach to software development, ensuring that the final product is delivered on schedule, stays within 
 budget, and fulfills user expectations. Each phase is built on the last, culminating in a successful software solution.


(d) Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  .Waterfall
  Waterfall is ideal for projects that have clear and stable requirements along with a well-defined scope. Some examples include:
  -Construction Projects – Building and infrastructure projects necessitate thorough planning before any execution begins.
  -Manufacturing Software – Systems for factory automation or embedded solutions that must adhere to strict compliance standards.
  -Regulatory and Compliance Software – Applications in banking or healthcare where changes can be expensive and require meticulous documentation.
  .Agile
  Agile is most effective for projects that have changing requirements and a focus on continuous improvement. Examples include:
  -Software Development Startups – Quick prototyping and the ability to adapt based on user feedback.
  -Mobile App Development – Applications like e-commerce platforms that need regular updates to meet user demands.
